[VNote](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote) is a note-taking application that knows programmers and Markdown better.
:::

## Features
- Built in Javascript and HTML5 and no need for server side processing.
- Easy to turn your **Markdown** files into an elegant website. Combined with VNote, it is crazy easy to turn your notebooks into a blog.
- No conversion of Markdown needed.
- Built via jQuery and Boostrap with responsive layout.
- Rich elements, such as **PlantUML**, **Flowchart.js**, **Mermaid**, and **MathJax**.

## How to use
For example, you have a folder named `notes` which contains your Markdown files:

```
notes/
  |-- v.md
  |-- i.md
  |-- k.md
  |-- work/
        |-- i.md
```

Download files of Viki, which may look like this:

```
css/
js/
index.html
index.md
viki.json
navigation.json
```

Copy all these files to `notes`. Copy `notes` to your web space and now you could visit your notes something like `your.web.space/#!v.md`.
